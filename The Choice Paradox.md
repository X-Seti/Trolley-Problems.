# Star Trek: The Next Generation
## "The Choice Paradox"

**FADE IN:**

**INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - DAY**

*The bridge hums with typical activity. CAPTAIN PICARD sits in his command chair, reviewing a PADD. DATA operates his console with mechanical precision.*

**PICARD**  
Mr. Data, report on our mission to Kepler-442b.

**DATA**  
Captain, we have successfully delivered medical supplies to the colony. However, I am detecting an unusual philosophical subroutine running in the colony's main computer.

**PICARD**  
Philosophical subroutine?

**DATA**  
It appears to be... a moral decision-making program. The colonists have been using it to resolve ethical dilemmas.

*TROI approaches, looking concerned.*

**TROI**  
Captain, I'm sensing something unusual from the planet. Strong emotions... conflict... but also curiosity.

**PICARD**  
On screen.

*The viewscreen shows a peaceful colony with what appears to be an old-style railway system.*

**RIKER**  
Railway transportation? That's... quaint for a 24th-century colony.

**PICARD**  
Indeed. Mr. Data, what exactly is this philosophical program doing?

**DATA**  
It appears to be running continuous ethical simulations, Captain. The most recent involves a scenario with a runaway transport, multiple potential casualties, and... a small humanoid child.

*PICARD raises an eyebrow.*

**INT. COLONY ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY**

*The away team - PICARD, DATA, TROI, and GEORDI - materialize. They're greeted by ADMINISTRATOR VENTH, a tall humanoid with silver skin and luminous eyes - a member of the Zakdorn species.*

**VENTH**  
Welcome to the Zakdorn Ethics Institute, Captain Picard. I trust you've heard about our programmable matter scenarios?

**PICARD**  
Your holographic simulations, yes. Though I understand they're more sophisticated than our own holodeck technology.

**VENTH**  
Indeed. We've developed programmable matter matrices that create perfect physical simulations. Our latest ethical framework involves complex moral scenarios using these constructs.

**DATA**  
Fascinating. May I interface with your programmable matter system?

**VENTH**  
Of course, Commander. But I should warn you - our matter matrices have developed rather... unpredictable ethical scenarios.

*DATA approaches a glowing crystalline interface.*

**DATA**  
I am accessing the current simulation matrix. It involves an automated transport pod approaching a junction in a matter-stream conduit system. There is a small humanoid construct on one pathway, and three individuals with non-functional optical sensors on the alternative route.

**TROI**  
Even in simulation, that's a terrible choice to face.

**DATA**  
The scenario parameters are... evolving. The individual controlling the junction has chosen to dematerialize and reintegrate between the transport pathways.

**GEORDI**  
Clever use of transporter technology. Assuming stable pattern buffers.

**DATA**  
The programmable matter infant has now... reconfigured itself toward a high-velocity transit network.

**TROI**  
This simulation is becoming increasingly complex.

**DATA**  
There are now references to... electromagnetic containment barriers... hostile xenomorphs... and antimatter generation facilities...

*DATA's expression becomes as confused as an android can manage.*

**DATA**  
Captain, I believe this program may have developed beyond normal parameters.

**INT. ENTERPRISE READY ROOM - LATER**

*PICARD sits across from CHEN.*

**PICARD**  
Administrator, I must ask - is this program generating purely hypothetical scenarios?

**VENTH**  
Well, Captain... some of our simulations are based on actual events recorded in our cultural databases.

**PICARD**  
Actual events?

**VENTH**  
Last cycle, we experienced a minor systems fluctuation with our matter-stream transport network. There was also an incident involving a family unit and their offspring near the transit pathways.

**PICARD**  
And the resolution?

**VENTH**  
The transport pod had been rerouted through an alternate matter conduit. The young one was safely located in our biological preserve's xenological habitat section one time-unit before our systems registered any potential hazard.

*PICARD's expression shows the familiar mixture of amusement and exasperation.*

**PICARD**  
So your programmable matter system has been generating complex ethical simulations... based on an incident that never posed any actual danger?

**VENTH**  
The elegance of philosophical inquiry, Captain, is that it transcends the need for genuine peril to explore authentic moral questions.

**INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - LATER**

*The away team has returned. DATA is at his station, still processing.*

**DATA**  
Captain, the colony's program has provided significant insight into the nature of moral decision-making under artificial constraints.

**PICARD**  
How so, Mr. Data?

**DATA**  
When presented with seemingly impossible choices, intelligent beings will often reject the premise entirely and seek alternative solutions. The subject consistently refused to accept binary outcomes.

**RIKER**  
Sounds familiar. How many times have we faced 'no-win scenarios' and found a third option?

**TROI**  
The Kobayashi Maru principle.

**PICARD**  
Indeed. The refusal to accept that there are no alternatives is perhaps the most human quality of all.

**DATA**  
I find it curious, Captain. The program generated increasingly complex scenarios, yet the resolution was elegantly simple - the danger was never real to begin with.

**GEORDI**  
Kind of like debugging a subroutine. Sometimes the problem isn't in the code you're looking at.

**PICARD**  
Set course for Starbase 74, Mr. Crusher. And Data?

**DATA**  
Yes, Captain?

**PICARD**  
Perhaps you could run your own simulation. But keep it simple - no alligators or electrical substations.

**DATA**  
I do not understand the reference to alligators, Captain.

*PICARD smiles knowingly as the ENTERPRISE warps away.*

**PICARD (V.O.)**  
*Captain's Log, supplemental. The colony's experiment reminds us that the most profound questions often arise not from the dilemmas themselves, but from our willingness to question their fundamental assumptions. In refusing to accept impossible choices, we often discover that the impossible was merely improbable... and the improbable, merely overlooked.*

**FADE OUT.**

**THE END**
